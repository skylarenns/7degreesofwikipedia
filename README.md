# Seven Degrees of Wikipedia

**Decommissioned October 8, 2026.** The production frontend displays “Project decommissioned. Have a good day!” Frontend API routes and the former lazy proxy return HTTP 410 without starting the graph backend. The backend service has been stopped; the source and graph artifacts are retained.

The documentation below describes the former Wikipedia shortest-path app.

## What It Does

- Discovers and parses local Wikipedia SQL dump files from `data/`
- Reads `page`, `redirect`, `linktarget`, and `pagelinks`
- Filters to main namespace articles only (`ns = 0`)
- Resolves redirect chains to canonical articles
- Builds a directed article graph with dense integer node IDs
- Persists a prebuilt runtime artifact to `artifacts/wiki-runtime.v8`
- Preloads the full runtime graph/index state into RAM on startup
- Exposes HTTP endpoints for resolve, suggest, pathfinding, status, and stats
- Proxies browser API calls through the Next.js server so clients only need the public frontend URL
- Tracks lifetime + current-session search analytics with disk persistence

## Runtime Design

The runtime is optimized for low query latency after startup, not low memory usage.

- Graph representation: CSR-style adjacency with `Uint32Array`
  - `forwardOffsets`
  - `forwardAdjacency`
  - `reverseOffsets`
  - `reverseAdjacency`
- Title resolution:
  - canonical title array
  - alias/redirect title array
  - exact lookup `Map<string, aliasIndex>`
  - prefix-sorted alias index for autocomplete
- Pathfinding:
  - bidirectional BFS
  - integer node traversal only
  - reusable typed-array scratch buffers
  - forward + reverse graph both resident in RAM
- Caching:
  - in-memory LRU-style path result cache for repeated lookups

This intentionally keeps redundant structures in memory because runtime responsiveness is the priority.

## Expected Dumps

Place the dump files in `data/`:

- `enwiki-*-page.sql.gz`
- `enwiki-*-redirect.sql.gz`
- `enwiki-*-linktarget.sql.gz`
- `enwiki-*-pagelinks.sql.gz`

The loader discovers these by pattern, so exact dated filenames are fine.

## Services

- Backend: Fastify API on `127.0.0.1:7878` by default
- Frontend: Next.js app on `0.0.0.0:4500` by default for self-hosting
- Vercel mode: host only the `frontend/` app on Vercel and point it at a public backend URL

The browser now calls same-origin `/api/*` routes on the frontend server. Those requests are forwarded server-side to the backend using `WIKI_BACKEND_URL` (defaults to `https://7wikiapi.skylarenns.com`).

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm --prefix frontend install
npm run build:graph
npm run start
npm run frontend:start
```

During development:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run frontend:dev
```

Build the frontend for production:

```bash
npm run frontend:build
```

To inspect an already-built artifact:

```bash
npm run inspect:artifact
```

## Build Pipeline

`npm run build:graph` performs the import/build flow:

1. Parse `page.sql.gz`
2. Keep only `page_namespace = 0`
3. Split canonical articles from redirects
4. Parse `redirect.sql.gz` and resolve redirect chains
5. Build canonical + alias lookup indexes
6. Parse `linktarget.sql.gz` and map modern link targets to canonical node IDs
7. Parse `pagelinks.sql.gz` twice
8. First pass counts graph degrees
9. Second pass fills forward/reverse CSR adjacency arrays
10. Persist the runtime artifact to disk

The runtime artifact is what the server loads into RAM at startup. The raw SQL dumps are not used during normal query serving.

## Vercel Frontend + Cloudflare Tunnel Backend

If you want the frontend on Vercel, deploy only the `frontend/` folder there and expose only the backend from your Linux server through Cloudflare Tunnel.

### Vercel project settings

- Framework preset: `Next.js`
- Root Directory: `frontend`
- Install Command: `npm install`
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: leave blank

### Vercel environment variables

- `WIKI_BACKEND_URL=https://7wikiapi.skylarenns.com`

Use the public Cloudflare Tunnel hostname for the backend here, not `127.0.0.1`.

### Linux backend startup

Use [deploy/start-backend.sh](/Users/skylarenns/Documents/6or7degreesofWikipedia/deploy/start-backend.sh) on the Linux server:

```bash
bash deploy/start-backend.sh
```

Or with explicit settings:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=7878 bash deploy/start-backend.sh
```

### Cloudflare Tunnel

Expose the backend port, which is `7878` by default.

For the production server, `deploy/lazy-proxy.mjs` can own port `7878` while the
full graph backend listens on `7879`. The proxy answers `/health` without waking
the graph, starts `7wiki-backend.service` for real API traffic, and stops it after
90 seconds without a visible-page heartbeat. Example user units are provided in
`deploy/7wiki-backend.service.example` and
`deploy/7wiki-lazy-proxy.service.example`.

Before a cold start, the proxy requires 12 GiB of `MemAvailable` by default. A
low-memory server gets an `insufficient_memory` 503 and the frontend shows the
reason instead of starting the graph. Override the preflight threshold with
`MIN_AVAILABLE_MEMORY_BYTES`. The example backend unit also caps the graph at
12 GiB and prevents it from consuming swap.

That means your tunnel should forward:

1. Public hostname like `https://wiki-api.yourdomain.com`
2. To `http://127.0.0.1:7878` on the Linux server

Then Vercel uses `WIKI_BACKEND_URL=https://7wikiapi.skylarenns.com`, and browsers continue hitting your Vercel site only.

Example tunnel config for the backend: [deploy/cloudflared.config.example.yml](/Users/skylarenns/Documents/6or7degreesofWikipedia/deploy/cloudflared.config.example.yml)

The important topology is:

1. Vercel hosts the Next.js frontend from `frontend/`
2. Browser requests `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/*`
3. Vercel route handlers proxy those requests to `https://wiki-api.yourdomain.com`
4. Cloudflare Tunnel forwards that hostname to `http://127.0.0.1:7878`
5. The Linux machine runs only the backend

### Stats Endpoints

- `GET /api/stats/session`
- `GET /api/stats/lifetime`
- `GET /api/stats/recent?limit=50`
- `GET /api/stats/performance?scope=lifetime`
- `GET /api/stats/top-searches`
- `GET /api/stats/connectors`
- `GET /api/stats/leaderboard`

These expose:

- total/success/failure counts
- duration aggregates
- approximate median / p95 / p99 via histograms
- average path length
- longest/shortest non-trivial discovered paths
- top start/end articles
- top article pairs
- top successful/failed searches
- top connector/bridge articles
- first-hop and last-hop leaderboards
- most frequently resolved redirects
- recent searches

## Notes

- The graph is directed because Wikipedia links are directed.
- Redirect pages are not runtime graph nodes; they resolve to canonical nodes.
- The importer is schema-driven enough to handle modern `pagelinks` with `pl_target_id`, and it can fall back to `pl_namespace` + `pl_title` if needed.
- If the runtime artifact is missing but all dumps are present, the server will auto-build once on first startup.
- If the dumps are incomplete, the server still boots and exposes status, but search endpoints will return a readiness error until the artifact exists.
- For the Vercel deployment shape, keep the backend bound to loopback on the Linux host and expose only port `7878` through Cloudflare Tunnel.
